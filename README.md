🎯 I'm a self-taught **Backend Developer** based in Uzbekistan with a strong focus on **Django**, **REST APIs**, **asynchronous tasks**, and **DevOps tools**. I love solving real-world problems and building clean, secure, and scalable systems.

I enjoy working on projects that involve:
- API design & documentation

- Authentication systems (JWT)
- Dockerized development & deployment
- CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions
